# Pizza Delivery System :pizza:

This is a Pizza Delivery System built as a part of my 4th semester project. It's a database project developed using MySQL.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

The Pizza Delivery System is designed to manage the details of orders, customers, and pizzas in a pizza delivery service. It allows users to add, update, view, and delete records. The system also provides various features like search functionality, sorting of records, and more.
